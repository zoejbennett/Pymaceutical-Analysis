# Pymaceutical-Analysis

This repository is an analysis of the effects of four new pharmaceutical drugs on tumor growth in mice over a 45 day span. The code merges and cleans two data frames and conducts statistical analyses
and visualization of the data. I utilized tutor Kourt Bailey as well as our class slack channel and Stack Overflow as resources when completing this project.
